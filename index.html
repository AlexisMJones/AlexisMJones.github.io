            <p>Hello! My name is Alexis and I am 24 years old. I am a business major but I am taking this course to learn more about web development. 
            My hobbies include (before COVID) going to the movies, going shopping, going out to shows, and going on trips with my bf and our two pups. 
            I'm always on the go with working full time as well as going to school full time. Life has been a little crazy lately but I'm glad I'm taking
        this course as well as getting to know all of you!! (: </p>
